main TODO's:

* the API of the table/route/destination structures needs to be a bit more fleshed out, based on the requirements of the http and telnet interface but the simplest seems that every "thing" (table, route, destination) exposes functions to manipulate it,
and internally takes care of its locking to avoid data races.

* update http and telnet admin interface for the new routing system
